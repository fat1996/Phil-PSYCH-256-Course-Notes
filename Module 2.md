Module 2: All about Alan Turing
Turing worked at Bletchley Park during WW2, breaking the German enigma codes. Eventually committed suicide, after having received 'treatment' to cure his homosexuality.
Turing test: Turing disguised himself as a heterosexual throughout his life, since homosexuality was illegal and frowned upon in Britain during that time. He resented having to lead a fake life, and he thought that he as being judged rather superficially by his peers. The basis of the turing test lies in the ability of the computer to disguise itself as a human i.e you shouldn't be able to distinguish betwwen the human and the computer. Interestingly, one can see the parallels between Turing's own life, and the background behind the turing test.
In the 1930s and 40s, Turing was the prime developer of the theory of computation and therefore one of the "founding fathers" of computer science. However, Turing was also interested in the possibility that an actual computing machine could be intelligent.
Turing proposes to address the question, "can machines think?'
Turing declines to use something like the dictionary definition of thinking in order to sort out the question.
A typical computer contains the following three components:

Memory (store): a place in which the computer can keep information as required for it to perform its calculations. For a human being doing an arithmetic problem, the appropriate kind of memory might be a piece of paper on which to write. For a digital computer, the appropriate kind of store would be a set of electronic circuits that can retain information that is sent to them and that can transmit that information when it is requested.
Executive unit: a component that coordinates the activity of the rest of the computer. In a typical modern computer, the executive unit is the Central Processing Unit (CPU), a component that retrieves information from storage, performs certain calculations using that information, and that sends the result for storage if that is appropriate.
Control: a set of instructions that tells the executive unit what calculations to carry out, and in what order. In modern terms, we would say that the control is the program that the computer is running. As Turing says, the program is like a list of rules that specify how an activity is to be performed. The computer is physically constructed so that the only actions that it performs (barring accidents) are those that are dictated by the program that it is running.
We could conclude that the intelligence of the computer, its ability to think, is a fact about the program and not a fact about the physical machine involved.
Some objections to the question of the ability of computers to think and Turing's responses to them:
1. The first objection is the theological objection.
Argument: thinking requires a soul, computers have no souls, so computers cannot think
Turing's reply: it only follows that computers do not think
Being omnipotent, God could give souls to computers, enabling them to think

2. The second objection is the mathematical objection.
The mathematical objection relies on some results of the theory of logic and computation. The idea behind this objection is that here is a question that a human can answer but that a given computer cannot.
Turing's reply: there may be such questions for any given human.Turing replies, correctly, that we have no assurance that there is no such question that someone could ask that we cannot answer.

3. The third objection is the consciousness objection.
The argument from consciousness holds that we cannot say that something thinks unless we know that it has conscious experiences.
Turing's answer is that although we might each reasonably conclude that we think and have phenomenological experiences, we cannot know that anyone else does. After all, my knowledge of these experiences is first-hand, and I have no such access to the mental lives of any of you. So, for all I know, I may be the only conscious being there is. And each of you might argue the same for yourselves. The view that one's own mind is the only thinking thing in existence is known as solipsism.

4. The fourth objection is from Lady Lovelace.
Lady Lovelace was a patron of Charles Babbage, who worked on building a mechanical computer called the Analytical Engine in the mid 19th century. Lady Lovelace noted that the Engine had no pretension to originality; it would do only whatever Babbage programmed it to do. Of course, as Turing points out, it may simply not have had the capacity to do anything original. It might be that a digital computer with greater capacity could display the originality that was lacking in the Analytical Engine.

Questions/concerns raised by the Turing test:
First, Turing deemphasizes the physical composition of the computer as a factor in assessing its intelligence and thinking ability. Turing holds that it is merely a historical accident that terms like "thinking" and "intelligence" are applicable only to humans or at least biological organisms. Had sophisticated digital computers been around since day one, we might well naturally ascribe thought and intelligence to them.
His paper contains a section (that we have not discussed) on how a computer might learn its knowledge from experience.
