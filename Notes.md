Introduction <br>
1. Cognitive Science: study of mind and intelligence
2. The Central Thesis of Cognitive Science is that thinking is like computation.
3. It is the claim that thinking, especially the thinking involved in intelligence, is analogous to the computations performed by a digital computer. 
4. Instead, the Central Thesis is more like what the philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn called a paradigm. In Kuhn's view a scientific paradigms fulfills at least the following functions:
	-It tells researchers what sorts of phenomena to investigate (and what sort to ignore),
	-It tells them what sorts of theories to test (and what sort not to test), and
	-It tells them how to perform the tests (and how not to).

Now we can see how the Central Thesis acts as a paradigm for Cognitive Science:
	-It tells researchers to investigate intelligent behaviours.
	-It tells them to theorize about mental representations and procedures.
	-It tells them to test theories using computational models, experiments, etc.

In Classic Cognitive Science, intelligent thinking is any thinking in which knowledge or expertise plays a major role.
Intelligence is knowledge-intensive: you need lots of knowledge to be intelligent, and the more knowledge you have, the more intelligent your behaviour will be.
Mental representations: some statements that describe where objects are in relation to each other. for eg, to remember a set of blocks that are stacked on top of each other. the set of statements that help us remember where the blocks are in relation to each other is called a mental representation.
Mental procedures are methods that our minds possess for manipulating mental representations of knowledge in order to achieve certain outcomes.
suppose we're given a set of blocks labelled with letters of the alphabet and we're asked to spell the word 'cat'. to do this, we'll come up with a plan to organize the blocks accordingly.
For now, the point is simply that we can think of mental representations and procedures as ways in which knowledge is packaged and applied in our minds.
In Cognitive Science, a theory is a model or explanation for how it is that people act intelligently in a given situation. More specifically, a theory in Cognitive Science makes claims about what mental representations are active in the situation and what mental procedures are used to apply the representations.
This approach to theory assessment is common in Cognitive Science and is generally referred to as cognitive modeling. That is, the operation of the computer program models or imitates the course of human thinking. The model is successful to the extent that it can reproduce the human behaviour that it is supposed to mimic.
The Central Thesis of Cognitive Science is that thinking is like computation on a digital computer. This thesis is called CRUM (Computational Representational Understanding of Mind) by Thagard. This thesis does not imply that your brain physically resembles a digital computer of the sort sitting on your desktop in your room. Instead, it asserts that just as computation in a digital computer is a matter of programs manipulating data representations, human cognition is to be understood as a process in which mental representations of information are manipulated by mental procedures of some sort.

Prehistory
The ancient Greeks, e.g., Plato and Aristotle, laid out the questions (and some of the sorts of answers) that cognitive scientists continue to pursue. The main questions are:
1. What do you know and how do you know it? (epistemology)
2. What kind of thing is a mind? (metaphysics)
3. How does a mind give rise to thinking? (psychology)

Plato (ca. 400 BC) gave the following answers (roughly speaking):
1. Knowledge is the grasp of true ideas (extrasomatic) and is obtained by the mind in a disembodied state.
2. A mind is collection of physical (hydraulic) and non-physical (immortal) organs.
3. Physical thinking is the interaction among mental organs via pressures and ratios of organic fluids.

Locke presents a very different model of human cognition (ca. 1690):
1. Knowledge is a set of general and tentative propositions gathered from sensory experience.
2. A mind is like a sheet of white paper onto which ideas are written by experience.
3. Thinking is a process of reflection in which ideas are abstracted from sensations.

In the 1940s, Wiener and others introduced a new model of mind called cybernetics based on an analogy with automatic range finders for anti-aircraft guns:
1. Knowledge is the information used to make predictions about futures states of the environment.
2. A mind is a set of feedback mechanisms connecting a body's sensory and motor apparatus.
3. Thinking is the adaptation of future conduct based on evaluation of past performance.

Finally, it is worth mentioning the behaviourist model of cognition, according to which we cannot make any scientific claims about knowledge, mind, or thinking.
The 1940s also saw the invention of electronic computers and the introduction of general theories of computation.
What was the original imitation game? By Alan Turing
Game played by 3 people i.e a man(A), a woman(B), and an interrogator(C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a different room that the other two. The objective of the game is for the interrogator to determine which of the two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by the labels X and Y, and he's allowed to ask them questions to help him achieve his objective. A sample question can be "Can X tell me what the exact length of their hair is?". Suppose X is actually A, so A will answer. A's objective in this game is to try and cause C to make the wrong identification. Throughout the game, the answers aern't spoken. Instead, they're handwritten, or better yet, typewritten to conceal any hints. The objective of B is to help the interrogator arrive at the correct identification. So they'll try to give the correct answers. She could say something like "I'm the woman!", but this wouldn't be too helpful since the man can make similar claims.
Turing asked the question "What would happen if a machine was to replace A's role?" How would the outcome of the game vary? Would the interrogator be able to differentiate between who's the computer and who's the human? This leads us to the question of whether machines can think.
Module 2: All about Alan Turing
Turing worked at Bletchley Park during WW2, breaking the German enigma codes. Eventually committed suicide, after having received 'treatment' to cure his homosexuality.
Turing test: Turing disguised himself as a heterosexual throughout his life, since homosexuality was illegal and frowned upon in Britain during that time. He resented having to lead a fake life, and he thought that he as being judged rather superficially by his peers. The basis of the turing test lies in the ability of the computer to disguise itself as a human i.e you shouldn't be able to distinguish betwwen the human and the computer. Interestingly, one can see the parallels between Turing's own life, and the background behind the turing test.
In the 1930s and 40s, Turing was the prime developer of the theory of computation and therefore one of the "founding fathers" of computer science. However, Turing was also interested in the possibility that an actual computing machine could be intelligent.
Turing proposes to address the question, "can machines think?'
Turing declines to use something like the dictionary definition of thinking in order to sort out the question.
A typical computer contains the following three components:

Memory (store): a place in which the computer can keep information as required for it to perform its calculations. For a human being doing an arithmetic problem, the appropriate kind of memory might be a piece of paper on which to write. For a digital computer, the appropriate kind of store would be a set of electronic circuits that can retain information that is sent to them and that can transmit that information when it is requested.
Executive unit: a component that coordinates the activity of the rest of the computer. In a typical modern computer, the executive unit is the Central Processing Unit (CPU), a component that retrieves information from storage, performs certain calculations using that information, and that sends the result for storage if that is appropriate.
Control: a set of instructions that tells the executive unit what calculations to carry out, and in what order. In modern terms, we would say that the control is the program that the computer is running. As Turing says, the program is like a list of rules that specify how an activity is to be performed. The computer is physically constructed so that the only actions that it performs (barring accidents) are those that are dictated by the program that it is running.
We could conclude that the intelligence of the computer, its ability to think, is a fact about the program and not a fact about the physical machine involved.
Some objections to the question of the ability of computers to think and Turing's responses to them:
1. The first objection is the theological objection.
Argument: thinking requires a soul, computers have no souls, so computers cannot think
Turing's reply: it only follows that computers do not think
Being omnipotent, God could give souls to computers, enabling them to think

2. The second objection is the mathematical objection.
The mathematical objection relies on some results of the theory of logic and computation. The idea behind this objection is that here is a question that a human can answer but that a given computer cannot.
Turing's reply: there may be such questions for any given human.Turing replies, correctly, that we have no assurance that there is no such question that someone could ask that we cannot answer.

3. The third objection is the consciousness objection.
The argument from consciousness holds that we cannot say that something thinks unless we know that it has conscious experiences.
Turing's answer is that although we might each reasonably conclude that we think and have phenomenological experiences, we cannot know that anyone else does. After all, my knowledge of these experiences is first-hand, and I have no such access to the mental lives of any of you. So, for all I know, I may be the only conscious being there is. And each of you might argue the same for yourselves. The view that one's own mind is the only thinking thing in existence is known as solipsism.

4. The fourth objection is from Lady Lovelace.
Lady Lovelace was a patron of Charles Babbage, who worked on building a mechanical computer called the Analytical Engine in the mid 19th century. Lady Lovelace noted that the Engine had no pretension to originality; it would do only whatever Babbage programmed it to do. Of course, as Turing points out, it may simply not have had the capacity to do anything original. It might be that a digital computer with greater capacity could display the originality that was lacking in the Analytical Engine.

Questions/concerns raised by the Turing test:
First, Turing deemphasizes the physical composition of the computer as a factor in assessing its intelligence and thinking ability. Turing holds that it is merely a historical accident that terms like "thinking" and "intelligence" are applicable only to humans or at least biological organisms. Had sophisticated digital computers been around since day one, we might well naturally ascribe thought and intelligence to them.
His paper contains a section (that we have not discussed) on how a computer might learn its knowledge from experience.
